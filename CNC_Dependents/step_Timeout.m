%STEP  Step response of dynamic systems.
%
%   [Y,T] = STEP(SYS) computes the step response Y of the dynamic system SYS.
%   The time vector T is expressed in the time units of SYS and the time
%   step and final time are chosen automatically. For multi-input systems,
%   independent step commands are applied to each input channel. If SYS has
%   NY outputs and NU inputs, Y is an array of size [LENGTH(T) NY NU] where
%   Y(:,:,j) contains the step response of the j-th input channel.
%
%   For state-space models,
%      [Y,T,X] = STEP(SYS)
%   also returns the state trajectory X, an array of size [LENGTH(T) NX NU]
%   for a system with NX states and NU inputs.
%
%   For identified models (see IDLTI and IDNLMODEL),
%      [Y,T,X,YSD] = STEP(SYS)
%   also computes the standard deviation YSD of the response Y (YSD is empty
%   if SYS does not contain parameter covariance information).
%
%   [Y,...] = STEP(SYS,TFINAL) simulates the step response from t=0 to the
%   final time t=TFINAL (expressed in the time units of SYS). For discrete-
%   time models with unspecified sample time, TFINAL is interpreted as
%   the number of sampling periods.
%
%   [Y,...] = STEP(SYS,T) specifies the time vector T for simulation (in
%   the time units of SYS). For discrete-time models, T should be of the
%   form 0:Ts:Tf where Ts is the sample time. For continuous-time models,
%   T should be of the form 0:dt:Tf where dt is the sampling period for the
%   discrete approximation of SYS.
%
%   [Y,...] = STEP(SYS,...,OPTIONS) specifies additional options such as the
%   step amplitude or input offset. Use stepDataOptions to create the option
%   set OPTIONS.
%
%   When called without output arguments, STEP(SYS,...) plots the step
%   response of SYS and is equivalent to STEPPLOT(SYS,...). See STEPPLOT
%   for additional graphical options for step response plots.
%
%   See also STEPPLOT, stepDataOptions, IMPULSE, INITIAL, LSIM, LTIVIEW,
%   DYNAMICSYSTEM, IDLTI.

%       Extra notes on user-supplied T:  For continuous-time systems, the system is
%       converted to discrete time with a sample time of dt=t(2)-t(1).  The time
%       vector plotted is then t=t(1):dt:t(end).

%STEP   Step response of continuous-time linear systems.
%	STEP(A,B,C,D,IU)  plots the time response of the linear system:
%		.
%		x = Ax + Bu
%		y = Cx + Du
%	to a step applied to the input IU.  The time vector is auto-
%	matically determined.  STEP(A,B,C,D,IU,T) allows the specification
%	of a regularly spaced time vector T.
%
%	[Y,X] = STEP(A,B,C,D,IU,T) or [Y,X,T] = STEP(A,B,C,D,IU) returns
%	the output and state time response in the matrices Y and X
%	respectively.  No plot is drawn on the screen.  The matrix Y has
%	as many columns as there are outputs, and LENGTH(T) rows.  The
%	matrix X has as many columns as there are states.  If the time
%	vector is not specified, then the automatically determined time
%	vector is returned in T.
%
%	[Y,X] = STEP(NUM,DEN,T) or [Y,X,T] = STEP(NUM,DEN) calculates the
%	step response from the transfer function description
%	G(s) = NUM(s)/DEN(s) where NUM and DEN contain the polynomial
%	coefficients in descending powers of s.
