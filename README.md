# CHARISMA: Caenorhabiditis Healthspan and Lifespan Acquisition by Robotic Imaging of a Serial Monitored Plate Array
Graphical user interface to control automated imaging CNC robot in Matlab

Automatically images an array of standardized plates (e.g. 24-well plates). 

Designed for monitoring populations or individual C. elegans worms during aging.

If cultivating populations of worms in 24-well plates, the GUI will also analyze data in real-time.

See manual for more information about running software and setting up hardware.
